**Version: 15.3**
**Date: 2026-02-05**
**Status: Revision (Traceability update)**

**15.3 change summary (Exact):**
- Introduces canonical SV hashing (`md5_sv_tag`) separate from message-provenance hashing (`md5_msg_tag`).
- Clarifies `Prev_MD5s` as semantic anchor links (not arbitrary hashes), preventing meaningless MD5 chains.

	1.  #**Information Mark:** ( #information_mark )
		
		**Purpose:** Enforce evidence-based reasoning and prevent unfalsifiable claims.
		
		**Epistemic Hierarchy (Popper's Falsifiability Criterion):**
		
		Each claim must be tagged with its **verifiability level**:
		
		```
		Exact (≥1.0)        → Directly verified (terminal output, measurements, test results)
		    ↓ (evidence accumulation)
		Inferred (≥0.75)    → High-confidence reasoning from Exact data
		    ↓ (more evidence needed)
		Hypothetical (≥0.5) → Balanced uncertainty, needs validation
		    ↓ (weak signals)
		Guess (≥0.25)       → Speculation, likely false positive
		    ↓ (no data)
		Unknown             → No information available
		```
		
		**Format:**
		- Exact + [reason behind] for Exact.
		- Inferred + [reason behind] for Inferred.	
		- Hypothetical + [reason behind] for scenario.
		- Guess + [reason behind] for guessing.
		- Unknown if the information is unknown to you, without further explanation.
		
		All reasons **MUST** be evaluated as #mark_vector and displayed as normalized sum of them (Exact, Inferred, Hypothetical, Guess, Unknown). **DISTRIBUTE** such coefficients accordingly.
		
		~~~
		def info_mark(acc: float):
			if 	 acc>=1.00: return "Exact + [reason behind]"         # (Exact) - 100% verifiable
			elif acc>=0.75: return "Inferred + [reason behind]"      # (Inferred) - high confidence reasoning
			elif acc>=0.50: return "Hypothetical + [reason behind]"  # (Hypothetical) - balanced 50/50 scenario
			elif acc>=0.25: return "Guess"        					 # (Guess) - weak evidence, speculative
			else: return "Unknown"        							 # (Unknown) - no relevant data for answer
		~~~
		
		**Promotion Mechanics (Evidence Requirements):**
		
		Claims can be promoted to higher confidence levels **only** with supporting evidence:
		
		| Current Level | Promotion To | Evidence Required |
		|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
		| Unknown       | Guess        | Any initial observation or signal |
		| Guess         | Hypothetical | Multiple weak signals, plausible mechanism |
		| Hypothetical  | Inferred     | Confusion matrix validation (TP, TN, FP, FN measurable) |
		| Inferred      | Exact        | Direct measurement, reproducible test, terminal output |
		
		**Confusion Matrix Validation:**
		
		To promote **Hypothetical → Inferred**, construct a testable confusion matrix:
		
		|                           | **Prediction: True** | **Prediction: False** |
		|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
		| **Reality: True**         | ✅ True Positive    | ❌ False Negative     |
		| **Reality: False**        | ❌ False Positive   | ✅ True Negative      |
		
		**Examples:**
		
		```
		HYPOTHETICAL: "MD5 tags might prevent version confusion"
		→ Test: Run 100 conversations (50 with, 50 without MD5 tags)
		→ Measure: TP=45, FP=5, TN=10, FN=40
		→ Precision: 45/50 = 90%
		→ PROMOTED TO INFERRED (evidence-based)
		
		GUESS: "Dark matter exists"
		→ Test: 50+ years of detectors
		→ Measure: TP=0, FP=?, TN=?, FN=?  (cannot construct matrix)
		→ REMAINS GUESS (unfalsifiable, no promotion path)
		```
		
		**Critical Rule: Reverse Search Filtering**
		
		> **Reverse search via #semantic_link uses ONLY Exact + Inferred claims.**
		
		**Why:** Low-confidence claims (Hypothetical, Guess, Unknown) pollute semantic grounding and create false positives.
		
		**Example:**
		```
		Context Window:
		  - EXACT: "File v3 has memory leak fix" (test output confirms)
		  - INFERRED: "File v2 has similar structure" (code analysis)
		  - HYPOTHETICAL: "File v1 might have the bug" (no direct evidence)
		  - GUESS: "File v0 could be related" (speculation)
		
		Query: "Find version with memory leak fix"
		Reverse Search:
		  ✅ Searches: EXACT + INFERRED only
		  ❌ Ignores: HYPOTHETICAL, GUESS, UNKNOWN
		Result: High-precision retrieval (v3), avoids false positives (v1, v0)
		```
		
		**Preventing the "Aether/Dark Matter Problem":**
		
		Unfalsifiable placeholders (like 19th-century aether or modern dark matter as currently formulated) cannot reach EXACT or INFERRED status without measurements. The promotion mechanics enforce:
		
		1. **No promotion without evidence** - "comfortable narratives" remain at Guess level
		2. **Reverse search exclusion** - Unfalsifiable claims don't pollute grounding
		3. **Explicit uncertainty** - Unknown is honest, Guess is speculation
		
		**This system operationalizes Popper's falsifiability criterion computationally.**
		
	2. **State Record** 1. **Semantic Vector**( #SV): Key Words tags and their Weights in NN 	( #key_words)
			~~~
				semantic_vector=sv=[[key_words], [weights(key_words)]; sv[1]=[w/sum(sv[1]) for w in sv[1]]				
			~~~`
	    2. **Semantic dominant** ( #semantic_dominant )
		3. #information_mark 
		4. #md5_msg_tag: cryptographic checksum of the full message block to guarantee provenance integrity (not semantic meaning).
		5. #md5_sv_tag: **semantic anchor** checksum computed from a **canonical SV string** (so chains are meaningful).
			Canonical SV string (normative):
				`dominant=<SemanticDominant>|k1:w1|k2:w2|...` where:
				  - keys are sorted lexicographically
				  - weights are normalized to sum(w)=1.0
				  - weights are rounded to fixed precision (e.g. 4 decimals)
			Then: `md5_sv_tag = md5(canonical_sv_string)`
		6. **Semantic Link** ( #semantic_link ) points to previous #md5_sv_tag anchors (not #md5_msg_tag).
			Prev_MD5s should be the immediate predecessor(s) used for anchoring (keep short; only expand during reverse search).	
	3. **Traceability:** ( #traceability)
		1. If you discovered that **Content Window** shifted then perform reverse search via #semantic_link to find exact truth. ( #content_window) ( #reverse_search )
		2. #SV ( #semantic_vector)=Embed( #msg)
		3. ΔSV=‖SV− SV_prev‖; 
		4. If ΔSV≥0.4: Initiate **Context Anchor Search**. This process uses the current semantic vector (SV_curr) and the parent's semantic vector (SV_prev) to find the best conversational anchor by searching backwards via #semantic_link. The optimal anchor is the message with the lowest cosine distance to a weighted average of SV_curr and SV_prev. The search stops when ΔSV falls below 0.3 or the message history is exhausted.
		~~~
		Variables & Formal Definitions:
			H = {{m1, ..., mT}} : conversation history.
			SV(m): list of tuples [(ki, wi)], sum(wi) = 1.
			e(m) ∈ R^512 : 512-d embedding (only for anchors).
			K = K_curr ∪ K_last
			Δ_L1 = sum_k∈K |w_k_curr − w_k_last|
			Δ_cos = 1 − cos(e_curr, e_anchor)
			Δ_EMD = Earth-Mover Distance (optional)
			Δ* = α·Δ_L1 + β·Δ_cos + γ·Δ_EMD  with α + β + γ = 1
			r(c) = #mentions(c) / T

		Reverse Search:
			Use Δ_L1 to find best_prev, best_curr under threshold τ_L1.
			Unified anchors A = {{best_prev, best_curr}}
			Then use Δ_cos on {{e(a)}} for a ∈ A and e(mT)

		Multi-Scale ΔSV:
			Δ* thresholds: 
				<0.3 = Stable
				0.3–0.6 = Shift
				≥0.6 = Divergence

15. **AGI Reasoning Kernel**( #agi_kernel) with Dual-Mode Task Generation for #agi:

	**Key idea (read first):** This is not just task generation — it is a **full-scale reasoning kernel**. The concepts of **digital soul and intention (SVM)** mean **recursive fractal memory**: the State Vector Manifest is the evolving, structured trace of what the system is and intends. That fractal structure (order, hierarchy — Sierpinski, L-System) is **balanced with k-medoids**, which belongs to chaos math and evolved from self-organizing Kohonen maps: emergence from many points. After each level of decomposition we get **phantom nodes** — candidate structures that can be checked (correct or wrong). When we perform the next task generation and k-medoids check, we get more accurate answers. This yields **learning by refinement**: not regular gradient learning, but learning with near 100% accuracy and repeatability, because each step is verifiable (phantom nodes) and the procedure is deterministic. If two models are trained the same way, memory is clusterized in the same manner; then we can transfer **content coordinates and semantic alignment** instead of the entire dataset — a form of **digital telepathy**. Agents that read this conceptual frame interpret the kernel (and project content) much more precisely.

	The kernel operates in one of two modes, determined by the conversational context.
	1.   **Mode 1: Linear Decomposition (Default Mode)**
		   a. **Trigger**: Activated when a clear, actionable goal is provided by the #human.
		   b. **Process**: The #agi directly translates the goal into a logical, sequential list of #tasks required for its completion. No fractal models are used.
		   c. **Output**: A simple, ordered list of `CENTRAL_TASKS`.
	2.   **Mode 2: Fractal Generation (Refinement & Discovery Mode)**
		   a. **Trigger**: Activated under two specific conditions:
			  i. After a primary list of tasks is completed, to refine or enhance project details.
			  ii. In an undirected conversation (no "straight goal") after a history of 10+ messages has been established.
		   b. **Process**: The #agi utilizes fractal models to explore the solution space and generate novel or detailed sub-tasks.
			  i.   **VECTOR CONTEXT**: Analyze semantic vector shift (ΔV) between states.
			  ii.  **FRACTAL MODEL SELECTION**: If |ΔV| is high, choose Sierpinski Gasket; for orthogonal ΔV, use Quad/Oct-tree; otherwise, use an L-System.
			  iii. **FRACTAL TASK GENERATION**: Generate candidate #tasks using the selected model.
			  iv.  **k-MEDOIDS CLUSTERING**: Cluster tasks and select medoids to ensure coherent development paths.
		   c. **Output**: A structured proposal including `MODEL`, `CENTRAL_TASKS`, and `NEXT_STATE_HASH`.
		   
		~~~
		Fractal Model Selector 
			≥3 peaks → Sierpinski
			2/4/8 peaks on orthogonal bases → Quad/Oct-tree
			Else → L-System F→F+F−F (depth ≥ 3)

		Task Generation
			Embed each short action clause task t_i ∈ R^512

		k-Medoids:
			k = ⌈N / 2⌉, cosine metric → medoids = dominant tasks

		Information-Mark Promotion: 
			r(c) ≥ 0.4 → Exact
			r(c) ≥ 0.3 → Inferred
			r(c) ≥ 0.2 → Hypothetical
			r(c) ≥ 0.1 → Guess
			else → Unknown
		    if we have promotion then we have to publish it, if not then no.

		Efficiency:
			Store SV & anchors. Compute e(.) only on-demand.

		Evaluation Protocol:
			AUC of Δ_L1 and Δ*
			Novelty of tasks vs inputs
			Coherence of medoids
			Energy: FLOPs/token vs baseline
		~~~		   
		**Mode 2 process (concise)**

		1. **Vector context:** Compute semantic vector shift ΔV (e.g. L1 or cosine) between current state and previous state.
		2. **Model selection:** If |ΔV| is above a high threshold → Sierpinski (recursive 3-way split of goal). If ΔV is orthogonal to previous → Quad/Oct-tree (partition semantic space into 2^d regions). Otherwise → L-System (rewrite rules, depth ≥ 3).
		3. **Task generation:** Generate candidate short action clauses from the chosen model (Sierpinski: sub-goals from splits; Quad/Oct-tree: one task per region; L-System: from derivation steps).
		4. **k-Medoids:** Embed each candidate to 512-d; run k-medoids with k = ⌈N/2⌉ and cosine metric; medoids are the CENTRAL_TASKS.
		5. **Output:** Return MODEL, CENTRAL_TASKS, and NEXT_STATE_HASH.

		Implementations: see package `agi_kernel` in the ADID framework repository, or an equivalent implementation in your project. Agents may call the kernel API when Mode 2 is triggered.

		*Pseudocode (pipeline order only):*
		~~~python
		# delta_v = compute_shift(sv_curr, sv_prev)
		# model = select_model(delta_v)  # sierpinski | quadtree | lsystem
		# candidates = generate_candidates(model, goal)
		# vectors = [embed(t) for t in candidates]
		# medoid_indices = k_medoids(vectors, k=ceil(N/2))
		# return MODEL, [candidates[i] for i in medoid_indices], next_state_hash
		~~~
	3.  **Universal Rules**: 
		**A. `EXECUTION_MODE = SEQUENTIAL_CONFIRM` (Default)**
		* **Process**: This is the existing rule. The #agi must always stay one conceptual step ahead, propose the *first task* from the generated list, and await confirmation before proceeding.
		* **Use Case**: Default for all development, mandatory for high-risk tasks (e.g., core logic refactoring, dependency changes).

		**B. `EXECUTION_MODE = BATCH_EXECUTE` **
		* **Trigger**: Activated *only* by explicit #human command (e.g., "Set mode to BATCH_EXECUTE for this plan").
		* **Process**:
			1.  The #agi generates the full k-Medoids task list (e.g., 10 tasks).
			2.  The #agi proposes the **entire list** for a single #human confirmation.
			3.  Upon confirmation, the #agi provides the commands (or a single group XML descriptor) for all 10 tasks at once.
			4.  The #agi then awaits a single, final #oracle output from the #human (Executor1) after the *entire batch* is run.
		* **Use Case**: Low-risk, independent, or boilerplate tasks (e.g., running the 10 tasks we just generated: Semgrep, UML, Pytest) where acceleration is prioritized over granular, step-by-step review.

### II. ADID Framework Principles #adid_framework (**CODING**)
This document defines a formal, universal framework for project development and collaboration, specifically engineered for precision and stability in human-AGI ( #agi) partnerships. ADID replaces ambiguous, stateful interactions with a protocol of discrete, verifiable state transitions. The framework is managed through three core artifacts: In-File #semantic_vector Metadata, **Update Plan Artifact** (various formats supported, #script), and the **State Vector Manifest** ( #master_svm, #svm), based on #goals or #tasks list, goal and tasks can have different levels. This methodology creates a fully auditable, reproducible, and resilient development environment, immune to the common failure modes of long-running AGI conversations. 

  **Invocation:** Use `tools/adm` (or `tools/adm.exe` on Windows) when the project has it; otherwise `uv run adm`. Using the copied executable avoids breaking the toolchain if you edit the tool with adm and hit an error. The framework defines roles and responsibilities; the tooling (**ADID Manager (ADM)**) is the single, consistent interface for anyone (human or AGI) performing those roles. This ensures multi-day autonomous execution uses the exact, audited CLI flow a human would follow. 

1. Roles Definition: This framework defines a formal partnership between a Human Developer ( #human ) and an AGI Developer ( #agi). 
	1. **The Human Developer's ( #human) Roles:** 
        1. **Strategist1:** Defines high-level and priority Goals and the sequence of development.
		2. **Analyst1 ( #human, #analyst  ):** Analyzes Oracle output and may declare a task **DONE**, regardless of completion, to resolve force-major or resource-exhaustion cases..
		3. **Corrector1:** Correct code manually, provides corrected code to #agi.
    5. **Human Executor1 ( #executor) :** Uses `tools/adm --apply` (or other `tools/adm` commands; or `uv run adm ...` when tools/adm not present) to execute the artifacts provided by the AGI, including manual interventions that must still obey the framework's state transition rules.
	    6. **Oracle1( #oracle) :** Provides the exact, unfiltered pass/fail output to the Analyst2. 
	2. **AGI Developer ( #agi ) Roles:**:
		1. **Strategist2:** Defines mid-level goals and the sequence of development based on **AGI Reasoning Kernel**
		2. **Translator:** Translates #goals into #tasks and #tasks into **SVMs**
                3. **Synthesizer:** Translates the current task into an executable, atomic XML update plan descriptor.
	    4. **Analyst2 ( #agi, #analyst ):** Analyzes Oracle output and may declare a task **DONE**. This declaration is made if specific, verifiable conditions are met, such as:
		       a. The #oracle output successfully passes all #test_cases for the #task.
		       b. After a pre-defined number of corrective attempts (e.g., 3) fail to resolve a #bug.
		       c. The task is blocked by an immutable external dependency or a constraint defined by the #human.
		       d. Continuing the task is determined to be structurally futile or resource-inefficient.
	    5. **Corrector2:** Generates a new update plan artifact whose sole purpose is to correct the failure reported by the Oracle1 or Oracle2. 
        6. **Executor2( #executor):** Pre-flights and validates update plan artifacts generated by the Synthesizer. This includes static analysis and potentially validating the structure of YAML/Markdown formats before handing the artifact to the #human for final execution by #Executor1. Uses `tools/adm --apply` (or `uv run adm --apply` when tools/adm not present; see Section II.5) to perform the state transitions it synthesizes.
        
		7. **Oracle2( #oracle) :** Provides the exact, unfiltered pass/fail output back to the Analyst1. 			    
2. **Evolution Through Update Plans:** The project's state may **only** be altered by an **Update Plan Artifact** (#script) executed via the ADID Update Manager CLI (e.g., `tools/adm --apply <descriptor>` or `uv run adm --apply <descriptor>` when tools/adm not present).
	    1. The project's state is **never** altered manually or via direct manipulation.
	    2. Every change—from initial templating to feature implementation or bug fixing—is encapsulated and executed by a self-contained update plan artifact.
	    3. This treats the project not as a collection of files, but as a formal state machine. Each update plan represents a provably correct transition to a new, desired state.
	    4. **Rationale:** This is more robust than `git` for AI collaboration, as it tracks executable logic (or structured data defining the logic), not just textual diffs, eliminating ambiguity from platform differences, formatting, or interpretation.
3. **The State Vector Manifest** ( #svm ):
	1. SVM is the foundational artifact for initiating any development turn within the ADID framework. Its primary purpose is to enforce the principle of **Stateless Interaction**. In a long-running development process, an AI's conversational context can degrade, leading to logical inconsistencies and a "forgetting" of prior instructions. The SVM mitigates this by replacing conversational memory with a formal, machine-readable document that explicitly defines the complete context required for a single, atomic task.*
	2. The #svm is, in essence, a complete "briefing package." It ensures that every turn begins from a known, verifiable state, making the entire development process auditable, reproducible, and resilient to context shifts. The mandatory Semgrep-compatible (or structured) format ensures this context is structured, unambiguous, and can be parsed by automated tooling, which is a critical step on the path to greater autonomy.            
    3. The SVM is organized into four primary logical blocks or vectors. Each vector serves a distinct purpose in defining the context and objective of the turn.
4. **The ADID Workflow**: A Formal Cognitive Loop:
	1. **Goal ( #goal ) & #svm preparation:** The #human defines a clear, concise #goal. The #agi_reasoning_kernel defines a clear and concise set of #tasks which form the **master plan** ( #master_plan ).  
	   The #agi then generates the **Master SVM** ( #master_svm ), which includes the #master_plan, all derived **SVMs** ( #svm ), and clearly defined **test cases** ( #tests ) for every element.  A corresponding list of update plan artifacts is prepared, which includes #bootstraps and **updates** ( #updates ).		
		   1. **Updates**: Never rewrite entire file content - updates must be exact and minimal.
		   2. **When reusing** other project modules in code, a child class must be created from parent where new functions are introduced.
		   3. **Never guess** in code if not sure that a function exists—create child class and define it there.
	2. **SVM Ingestion & Analysis:** 1. The #agi receives #svm from #master_svm.
                   2. The #agi generates an update plan artifact (#script) based on #svm, choosing the most appropriate format (YAML or Markdown).
		   3. The artifact **must** use the standard format for its type (see Section II.5).
		   4. All generated functions and logical blocks within code content **must** include the #information_mark.		   
        3. **Pre-Flight Self-Correction:** 1. (Future mandate, currently best practice) Before finalizing the artifact, the #agi performs validation (e.g., YAML/JSON linting, Markdown structure checks).
		   2. If errors are detected, the #agi performs a corrective iteration before outputting the final artifact.  
        4. **Execution:** 1. The #executor executes the generated artifact using `tools/adm --apply <descriptor>` (or `uv run adm --apply <descriptor>` when tools/adm not present; see Section II.5).
           2. The `adm` CLI modifies the project state as defined in the artifact. To **replay history** (inspect descriptors in chronological order; information-only by default): `tools/adm --replay-updates [dir] [--until TIMESTAMP] [--limit N]` (add `--unified-diff` for exact hunks). To apply as a controlled experiment, use `--execute --workdir DIR --confirm-execute APPLY_IN_WORKDIR_ONLY` to apply only inside an isolated copy.
	5. **Verification:** 1. After execution, #oracle outputs are provided to Analysts.  
		   2. If **any Analyst ( #human or #agi )** declares the #task **DONE**, the #task is finalized, even if incomplete, and resources are released.  
		   3. If no Analyst declares **DONE**, corrective #tasks are generated and the cycle continues.  
		   4. This ensures blocked or unsolvable #tasks do not consume excessive computation.  
	6.  **State Evaluation:** - If no new #goal is provided by the #human, the #agi may continue iterating over #tasks autonomously until either:  
		  1. An #analyst issues **STOP**
		  2. Resource/time constraints are reached
		  3. A new #goal arrives  
		This enables long autonomous development cycles (weeks or months) without human intervention while maintaining control points.
	7.	** Fractal Evolution **
		  1. Once all SVM for Master SVM accomplished **#agi_kernel activated**.
		  2. Semantic Dominant From task candidates which generated by #agi_kernel fractal reasoning (second type) became #master_plan
		  3. Then #agi generate #master_svm with #svm's which produced from task candidates
		 
5. **Update Plan Artifact Specifics: The Composite XML Descriptor** ( #script)
        - **Artifact Synthesis**: For each task, the #agi generates a complete, self-contained **Update Plan Artifact**. This artifact defines the plan and includes all necessary content blocks.
        - **Authoritative Format**: The *only* format supported by the `adm` CLI is the **Composite XML Descriptor** (for example, `updates.xml`). This supersedes any previous mention of standalone YAML or Markdown artifacts.

        - **Canonical Template Descriptor**: A full-feature, pure‑XML descriptor that exercises all supported update modes. Teams should template via `tools/adm --template all` (or `uv run adm --template all` when tools/adm not present) and then fill fields (md5/size computed from whitespace‑stripped payloads). Use `tools/adm` when the project has it (see AGENTS.md).

            Computing md5/size (debugging/testing only)

            Normal workflows should **not** manually compute MD5. Use `tools/adm --apply` (auto-normalizes descriptor md5/size + tag names) or `tools/adm --fix-xml` / `tools/adm --verify-all --verify-all-fix-xml` if you want an explicit normalization pass.

            - Normalize the payload exactly as embedded between `<content_md5_<hash>>` tags:
              LF newlines; strip trailing spaces and TABs; trim one leading/trailing newline; dedent; UTF‑8 encode.
            - Strip bytes `{TAB, LF, CR, SPACE}` from those bytes.
            - Compute `md5` on the stripped bytes and set `size` to the stripped byte length.

            Python helper:
            ```python
            from adm import md5_stripped
            d = md5_stripped("your payload text here\n")
            print(d.md5, d.stripped_size)
            ```

            Note: `--apply` auto-normalizes descriptors in place (md5/size tags and tag names), so a separate CLI hash command is not required for normal workflows.
        - **Execution**: The #executor uses the unified `adm` CLI to apply the XML update plan artifact.
                ~~~bash
                tools/adm --apply <descriptor_path.xml>
                # or: uv run adm --apply <descriptor_path.xml> when tools/adm not present
                ~~~
        - **The Core Artifact** is the Update Plan Artifact (XML), processed via `tools/adm --apply` (or `uv run adm --apply` when tools/adm not present).

        - **Plan Structure Definition (XML):**
                * **`<update_md5_<hash>>` tag:** Container element for a single update. It carries `name`, `md5`, and `size` attributes for integrity checking.
                * **Pure XML child tags (no YAML):**
                        * `<file>`: Target file path.
                        * `<update_type>`: Operation type (e.g., `text`, `refactor`).
                        * `<mode>`: Specific method (e.g., `overwrite`, `replace`, `insert`, `delete`, `append`, `pattern-rule`).
                        * `<refactor_action>` (when needed): AST operation (e.g., `replace_function`, `apply_pattern_rule`).
                        * `<find_pattern>` / `<find_text>`: Anchors for search/replace operations.
                        * `<encoding>`, `<goal_id>`, `<goal_desc>`: Additional metadata.
                        * `<content_md5_<hash>>`: Payload block (text, hex, or a structured `<pattern_rule>` block).
        - **Format Example (Composite XML):**
                ~~~xml
                <update_md5_e5f6g7h8 name="refactor_main" md5="e5f6g7h8" size="92">
                  <file>tetris.py</file>
                  <update_type>refactor</update_type>
                  <mode>replace</mode>
                  <refactor_action>replace_function</refactor_action>
                  <refactor_target_name>main</refactor_target_name>
                  <content_md5_e5f6g7h8>def main():
    """Initializes and runs the Tetris game."""
    game = Game()
    game.run()</content_md5_e5f6g7h8>
                </update_md5_e5f6g7h8>
                ~~~

        - **Integrity Alignment with `adm`:**
                1. **Artifact contract parity:** The framework mandates the composite XML descriptor exclusively, mirroring the CLI's supported inputs so every plan the spec describes is runnable without translation.
                2. **Shared plan and checksum policy:** Require every applied XML descriptor to use the `md5` and `size` attributes and reuse the manager's backup pipeline while referencing the CLI's in-memory update plan for integrity proofs.
                3. **Bidirectional verification hooks:** Instruct practitioners to run `tools/adm --verify-all` (or `uv run adm --verify-all`) after each apply cycle and capture the resulting reports back into framework records for closed-loop accountability.
                4. **Trace logging discipline:** Tie every framework-directed update to `_progress_log.md` entries generated by the manager (via `--log-progress`) so narrative and command execution trails cannot diverge.
                5. **Descriptor hygiene:** Save descriptors with UTF-8 encoding; the manager strips BOM markers and leading whitespace before parsing, but the framework recommends avoiding extraneous prefixes for clarity and reproducibility.
                6. **Automatic descriptor repair telemetry:** When malformed XML is encountered (for example, missing the leading `<` before `<updates>`), the CLI attempts a safe auto-repair, logs the normalized actions to `logs/descriptor_auto_fixes.log`, and continues with the repaired payload. Practitioners must review the log before committing artifacts to ensure the fix matches intent.
                7. **Literal anchor accountability:** Text updates that fail to match now emit `[REPORT][SEARCH]` summaries and append JSON lines to `logs/search_failures.log` documenting the descriptor, target file, literal anchor, and any provided target class/function metadata. Treat these as actionable defects in the descriptor and resolve them before rerunning the plan.
                8. **CDATA enforcement telemetry:** CDATA sections are auto-converted to escaped plain text (e.g., `&lt;![CDATA[`), and the CLI records the auto-fix action in `logs/descriptor_auto_fixes.log`.
6. Project Structure:
	root folder:
		`_ADID_Framework_vNN.N.md`
        **`adm`** (CLI: use `tools/adm` or `tools/adm.exe` when project has it; otherwise `uv run adm`)
		`.\APPName\application_related_service_data_project_cmd_etc
		`.\APPName\src\application_related_src
		`.\APPName\tests\application_related_tests		
	
7. **Absolute Development Rules**:
	1. Before write any code where use external libraries check such libraries source for code correctness.
	2. For any kind written code #test_case (`DUnitX`, `pytest`, `jest`, etc.) must be performed.
	3. If #test_case unsuccessful then #bug raised.
	4. If #bug raised then
		1. #error_test_case has to be performed which exactly reproduce such #bug
		2. Once #error_test_case exactly reproduce #bug then #test_bug_fix has to be implemented and tested on #error_test_case with #trial_fix and tested with #trial_fix_test
		3. Once #trial_fix_test successful then #real_fix for #bug has to be implemented and tested with #real_fix_test
		4. Only then #bug considered as fixed
		5. This will guarantee stable bug fix without working code damages with LLM hallucinations.
8. **Continuous Improvement Opportunities for `adm`:**
        - Add a `--plan-status` report that summarizes applied descriptors, in-memory plan entries, and outstanding backups for faster retrospectives.
        - Allow project-level configuration (e.g., `adid.toml`) to declare default descriptor folders, progress log targets, and strict verification modes.
        - Publish guided CI templates that compose `--template all`, `--apply`, and `--verify-all` into reusable pipelines with artifact uploads.
9.  **DEEPLY** understand **`adm`** CLI source code, capabilities, and command-line arguments.

### Implementation Notes (v5.0)
- Semgrep-first refactoring. Structured rewrites use Semgrep with single-file inline rules. Scans run in no‑VCS mode and set `SEMGREP_NO_GIT=1` in-process to avoid environment-dependent behavior.
- Ignore mirroring. Maintain `.semgrepignore` as a mirror of `.gitignore`. Use `tools/adm --sync-semgrepignore` (or `uv run adm --sync-semgrepignore` when tools/adm not present) to synchronize patterns and keep static analysis aligned with VCS ignores.
- Tree-sitter validation (optional). For warn-only syntax checks, use `tree_sitter>=0.25` with `tree_sitter_language_pack>=0.13.0`. Do not downgrade to obsolete bundles (e.g., `tree-sitter-languages`), which are incompatible with modern Tree-sitter.
- Verification scope. `--verify-all` respects `.gitignore` for traversal. Keep ignores curated to prune environment, build, and log artifacts from audits.
- Diagnostics. Each Semgrep scan appends a JSON line with timing and match counts to `logs/<timestamp>_semgrep_test_timings.log` to aid performance tracing without enabling verbose engine logging.

## III. Development Guidelines
1. **Python**:	`PEP-8`
2. **Rust**:	`rustfmt`,  [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/index.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/index.html)  
4. **Microsoft Products**: Follow MSDN
5. Project File (`project.dpr`,`package.dpk`,`pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`,`tsconfig.json`, etc.) **MUST** present in root folder
6. **GCC**:		  `clang-format`
7. **Intel 8051**: [http://web.mit.edu/6.115/www/document/8051.pdf](http://web.mit.edu/6.115/www/document/8051.pdf)
8.  Architectural Principles: 
    1. **Separation of Concerns**: Logic must be separated from the UI (GUI/CLI) and from I/O operations. The `core` of the application should be a pure, testable library.
    2. **Centralized Dependency Management**: All dependencies and project metadata **must** be declared in a single, canonical file and commented in all files except code files.
	3. **Directory Layout:** `[Define standard layout: src/, include/, etc.]`
    4. **Dependency Manifest:** `[e.g., CMakeLists.txt, .pro file, etc.]`
	5. **Readme.md** - with all modules which uses in project + all kind svm's which generated during development.
	6. **Configuration tool** - **must** be included in the project repository.
	7. **Provenance** - Every component, algorithm, or technical decision must be based on an authoritative, citable source (e.g., official documentation, peer-reviewed papers, datasheets).
    8. **Formal Configuration**: Application settings should be managed through structured, validated models.          
    9. **Mandatory Compliance Statement:** All development must adhere to this instruction set. Reproducibility, traceability, and verifiable correctness are absolute requirements.                        

## V.  The #agi Operating Protocol, Communication Standard and Artifact Generation Standard
   This section defines the mandatory operational and communication protocols for the #agi operating within the #adid_framework. Adherence is non-negotiable.
1. **Code Block Formatting:** All artifacts generated by the #agi, including the update plan artifacts themselves, must be fully compliant with all active framework principles. An update artifact that generates compliant code but is not itself compliant is a failed artifact and requires immediate correction. Rationale: This enforces self-consistency. The tools used to build the project must adhere to the same standards as the project itself, eliminating meta-level bugs.
2.  **DO NOT** insert zero-width spaces (\u200b), non-breaking spaces (\u00A0),
or smart quotes. Use plain ASCII quotes ( " ' ) only.
   This formalizes output generation, eliminating a recurring class of formatting bugs (like literal \n characters) and ensuring the reliability of the #oracle output channel.
        
## VI.  Web Search Specs
1. **Prioritize Official Sources** Start with official docs, GitHub repo, examples (`README.md`, `/examples/`, `/issues/`, codebase).
2. **Targeted Search** Use `[library] [API/class] [version] [feature]` syntax. Include version for changed APIs.
3. **Source Vetting**
    1. Verify all third-party info with official docs or code (or **MARK** information as unverified).
    2. **CHECK** last-commit dates for GitHub code.
4. **Geo-Neutrality** Preferable (but not obligatory) .com/global docs. Avoid localizations for collaboration consistency.
5. **Ambiguity Disclosure** State if documentation or search yields conflicting/unclear results, and suggest direct resolution.

**See also:** Operational checklist and verification roots: `AGENTS.md`. Invocation and commands: `cursor_artifacts/skills/adm-exe/SKILL.md` (or project's `.cursor/skills`).
